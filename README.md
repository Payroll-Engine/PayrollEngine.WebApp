## Web Application Server
To run the web application server, the web host must support the execution of .NET Core applications. For local development, [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) serves as the host in two execution variants:
- [CLI dotnet command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) using the command within the binary folder:
```
start "" dotnet PayrollEngine.WebApp.Server.dll --urls=https://localhost:7179/
```

- Visual Studio Solution `PayrollEngine.WebApp.sln` using the debugger.

## User Login
When logging in for the first time, the user must choose a password that complies with the following rules:
- at least 8 characters
- 1 numeric character
- 1 lower case character
- 1 upper case character
- 1 special character

### Developer login
In debug mode the web application can be started with an automatic login. The desired context is defined with the program settings `AutoLogin`, `StartupTenant` and `StartupUser`. In this mode it is possible to switch between the tenants.

## Application Configuration
