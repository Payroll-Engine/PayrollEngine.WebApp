# Payroll Engine Web Application
ðŸ‘‰ This application is part of the [Payroll Engine](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine/wiki).

The Web Application provides full access to the Payroll Engine. For a better understanding of the working concepts, it is recommended to read the [Payroll Engine Whitepaper](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine/blob/main/Documents/PayrolEnginelWhitepaper.pdf).

## Features

## Web Application Server
To run the web application server, the web host must support the execution of .NET Core applications. For local development, [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) serves as the host in two execution variants:
- [CLI dotnet command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) using the command within the binary folder:
```
start "" dotnet PayrollEngine.WebApp.Server.dll --urls=https://localhost:7179/
```

- Visual Studio Solution `PayrollEngine.WebApp.sln` using the debugger.

## User Login
When logging in for the first time, the user must choose a password that complies with the following rules:
- at least 8 characters
- 1 numeric character
- 1 lower case character
- 1 upper case character
- 1 special character

### Developer login
In debug mode the web application can be started with an automatic login. The desired context is defined with the program settings `AutoLogin`, `StartupTenant` and `StartupUser`. In this mode it is possible to switch between the tenants.

## Application Configuration
The server configuration file `appsetings.json` contains the following settings:

### Startup Configuration

### Serilog
File and console logging with [Serilog](https://serilog.net/).

> It is recommended that you save the application settings within your local [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets).

## Application Logs
The web application server stores its logs in the application folder `logs`.

## Api Key
If a key is required to access the backend API, it must be obtained from one of the following sources (in order of priority):

1. Environment variable `PayrollApiKey`.
2. From the [Payroll HTTP configuration](#payroll-http-configuration).

## Input Attributes
The case input attributes can be used to control the behavior of user input.

ðŸ‘‰ Input Attributes [Reference](Input-Attributes.md).
